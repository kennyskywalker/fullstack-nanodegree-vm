from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")

def index():

return "Homepage"

@app.route("/profile/<name>")

def index1(name):

return render_template("Profile.html", name=name)

if __name__=="__main__":

app.run(debug=True)

Hi there, you have missed shebang which is causing this problem.

Interpreter is not able to find out in which version of python this code has been written.

For python 2 you just need to add this line on the top of your code

#!/usr/bin/env python

If you have used python 3 then add this line

#!/usr/bin/env python3

Not sure if you got this resolved, but I had a similar issue and though I'm not sure if it actually is the "right" way to do it I was able to get the Hello World app running by executing the following:

$ export FLASK_APP=<yourfile.py>
$ python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0
See http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart

In the video (as of this this posting) it shows us how to run it by using:

$ python project.py
Which gave this:

 * Serving Flask app "project" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
